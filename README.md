Coeus
=====
Version: 7.x-1.x
Current Maintainer: Richard Buchanan <richard_buchanan@buchanandesigngroup.com>

Coeus is planned as a lightweight, flexible, 12-column, responsive, HTML5 /
RDFa 1.1 standards compliant Drupal 7 base theme.

The name Coeus is derived from a Titan in Greek mythology. Like most Titans, he
played no active part in Greek religion, but was primarily important for his
descendants. Which is fitting for this theme, since it is meant as a base theme
for full HTML5 support on Drupal 7 sites. I am actively maintaining this sandbox
project, although any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Included is a sub-theme for fine-grained customization. Use this to test out the
base theme and test it against validators such as the W3C Nu Markup Validation
Service (validator.w3.org/nu/).
